    <h2>Do it yourself and ditch the box!</h2>
    <p>Forget the hamburgers you were going to make, or the same old mac and cheese.
    This dish is a combo of our favorites. 
    Every bite is filled with a lot of flavor; a little spice and <strong>A LOT</strong> of cheese! Lets get started.</p>
    <p><strong>(Serves Four)</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 mins</p>
    <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 25 mins</p>
    <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> 35 mins</p>
    <h3>*Ingredients*</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>6 ounces Cheddar cheese, <em>shredded</em> (about 1 1/2 cups) </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>*Directions*</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until beef is crumbled, browned, and no longer pink (about 7 minutes). Spoon off and discard any fat.</li>
    <li><em>Stir in</em> tomato paste, ketchup, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, paprika, and pepper; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant (about 2 minutes).</li>
    <li>Add beef broth, and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in macaroni; reduce heat to medium, and gently boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed (13 to 15 minutes)</li>
    <li>Remove from heat, and stir in Cheddar, ensuring cheese is fully melted and incorporated (30 to 45 seconds). Let stand until thickened before serving (about 2 minutes).</li>
