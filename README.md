# HTML Commands
# This project is a display of knowledge on HTML. Here I used VS Code and the command line to create multiple .html files and directories that make up pages of home cooked meals. Each page is formatted for HTML specifying Document type, language and character set so the browser can correctly read and display. We have a simple title within the Head making up the boilerplate. After the Head is closed I started with a heading following a body and everything else within the body. There are anchor tags and elements that forward you to each recipe and back to home from each recipe. I used image source tags that lead through my directories to each photo document to display the food. Within you can see the use of bold and italic lettering, paragraphs, more headings, numbered lists and bullet-point unordered lists with there respective opening and closing tags. These recipes were gathered from allrecipes.com and all credit goes to The Odin Project.
